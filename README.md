# Data_Visualization_Titanic-
This repository contains a Data Visualization project that explores and visualizes the Titanic dataset using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

# Project Goals-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and patterns in the data.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, impute data, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Visualization: Create informative visualizations to better understand the characteristics of the passengers and their survival outcomes.
Outlier Treatment: Implement outlier treatment methods to enhance the robustness of the analysis.

# Dataset-
The Titanic dataset is sourced from Seaborn's built-in datasets and includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as age, class, fare, and survival status.

# Dependencies-
Python 3
Jupyter Notebooks
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
